6. [stringr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html) - Stringr provides an opinionated interface to strings in R. It makes string processing simpler by removing uncommon options, and by vigorously enforcing consistency across functions.
7. [validate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html) - The validate package makes it super-easy to check data against domain knowledge. It works by allowing you to define data validation rules independent of the code or data set.

### Data Visualization
8. [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) - Powerful, flexible and well-thought-out dataviz package following 'grammar of graphics' syntax to create static graphics, but be prepared for a steep learning curve.
9. [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) - Plotly's R graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online. Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts and bubble charts.
